What does SERIAL do?

Return all main courses. Hint: What ActiveRecord method would you use to get this?
intermediate_sql=# SELECT NAME, REVENUE FROM items WHERE COURSE = 'main';
      name      | revenue
----------------+---------
 veggie lasagna |    1000
 striped bass   |     500

Return only the names of the main courses.
intermediate_sql=# SELECT NAME FROM items WHERE COURSE = 'main';
      name
----------------
 veggie lasagna
 striped bass
(2 rows)

Return the min and max value for the main courses.
intermediate_sql=# SELECT max(revenue), min(revenue) FROM items WHERE COURSE='main';
 max  | min

 1000 | 500
(1 row)

What's the total revenue for all main courses?
intermediate_sql=# SELECT sum(revenue) FROM items WHERE course='main';
 sum
------
 1500

Can you get it to display only the name for the item and the name for the season?


Having two columns with the same name is confusing. Can you customize each heading using AS?
